Your roof is your home's first line of defense against the elements. But how do you know when repairs won't cut it anymore and it's time for a full replacement? Here are the 8 warning signs every homeowner should know.

## 1. Your Roof Is 20+ Years Old

Most asphalt shingle roofs last 20-25 years. If yours is approaching this age, it's time to start planning for replacement—even if it looks okay from the ground.

**Pro tip**: Check your home improvement records or ask previous owners when the roof was last replaced.

## 2. Shingles Are Curling or Buckling

Curled or buckled shingles are a clear sign of weathering and indicate your roof is past its prime. Look for:

- **Cupping**: Edges turning upward
- **Clawing**: Middle of shingle coming up
- **Buckling**: Visible waves or distortion

These issues allow water to seep underneath, leading to leaks and structural damage.

## 3. Missing or Cracked Shingles

Individual missing or cracked shingles can often be replaced. But if you're constantly finding shingle granules in your gutters or missing shingles after every storm, your roof's integrity is compromised.

**Warning sign**: Check your gutters. Excessive granules (looks like coarse sand) means your shingles are deteriorating.

## 4. Daylight Through Roof Boards

Go into your attic on a sunny day. If you can see daylight streaming through the roof boards, water can get in too. Also check for:

- Water stains
- Dark streaks
- Sagging areas

## 5. Sagging Roof Deck ⚠️

**This is the most critical warning sign.** A sagging roof indicates structural damage, possibly from:

- Long-term water damage
- Too much weight (poor ventilation causing ice dams)
- Inadequate support

**Don't wait**: A sagging roof can collapse. Contact a roofing professional immediately.

## 6. Higher Energy Bills

A failing roof affects your home's insulation. If you've noticed:

- Steadily increasing energy bills
- Difficulty maintaining temperature
- HVAC running constantly

Your roof may not be providing adequate insulation anymore.

## 7. Moss, Mold, or Algae Growth

While some algae is cosmetic, extensive moss or mold growth can indicate trapped moisture. Moss can actually lift shingles, creating gaps for water entry.

**Caution**: Don't pressure wash—this damages shingles. Professional cleaning or replacement may be needed.

## 8. Neighbors Are Replacing Their Roofs

Homes in the same neighborhood are often built around the same time with similar materials. If your neighbors are getting new roofs, yours may be due too.

## Repair vs. Replace: Making the Decision

| Repair Makes Sense | Replace Is Better |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Roof is under 15 years old | Roof is 20+ years old |
| Damage is localized | Damage is widespread |
| Minor storm damage | Multiple leaks |
| Budget is tight (short-term) | Planning to sell home |

## Cost of Roof Replacement

Average costs vary by material and region:

- **Asphalt shingles**: $5,000 - $12,000
- **Metal roofing**: $10,000 - $25,000
- **Tile roofing**: $15,000 - $35,000
- **Slate**: $25,000 - $50,000+

## What to Do Next

If you've noticed any of these warning signs:

1. **Document the damage** with photos
2. **Get a professional inspection**—many roofers offer free inspections
3. **Get multiple quotes** (we recommend at least 3)
4. **Check your homeowner's insurance**—storm damage may be covered
