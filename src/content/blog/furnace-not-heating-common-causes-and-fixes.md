## Step-by-Step Furnace Troubleshooting Guide

Follow these steps in **exact order**—each builds on the previous one:

### Step 1: Check Your Thermostat (Success Rate: 25%)

1. **Verify temperature setting** is at least **3°F higher** than current room temperature
2. **Switch to "Heat" mode** (not "Auto" or "Cool")
3. **Set fan to "Auto"** (not "On")
4. **Replace batteries** if display is dim or blank
5. **Wait 5 minutes** for system to respond

**Red flags**: Thermostat display blank, temperature reading seems off by more than 2°F, or settings keep reverting.

### Step 2: Inspect the Air Filter (Success Rate: 35%)

**Location**: Usually in return air duct or furnace cabinet

**How to check**:
1. **Remove filter** and hold up to light
2. **Replace immediately** if you can't see light through it
3. **Check filter size** on frame (common sizes: 16x25x1, 20x25x1, 16x20x1)
4. **Install with airflow arrow** pointing toward furnace

> **Pro Tip**: A **dirty filter** reduces airflow by up to **50%**, triggering safety shutoffs. This single issue causes more "no heat" calls than any other problem.

**Filter replacement schedule**:
- **1-inch filters**: Every 30-90 days
- **4-inch filters**: Every 6-12 months
- **Homes with pets**: Replace 50% more frequently
- **During high-use seasons**: Check monthly

### Step 3: Examine Circuit Breakers and Power (Success Rate: 15%)

1. **Check furnace power switch** (looks like light switch near unit)
2. **Inspect circuit breakers** in electrical panel
3. **Look for tripped breakers** (switch in middle position)
4. **Reset by switching OFF, then ON**
5. **Check for blown fuses** in older homes

**Warning signs**: Burning smell, scorch marks around outlets, or breakers that immediately trip again.

### Step 4: Clear Blocked Vents and Returns (Success Rate: 12%)

**Supply vents** (blow warm air):
- **Remove obstructions** (furniture, curtains, toys)
- **Open all vents** at least 75%
- **Check for crushed ducts** in crawl spaces

**Return vents** (pull air back to furnace):
- **Remove dust buildup** on grilles
- **Clear 2-foot radius** around returns
- **Check basement returns** for debris

**Impact**: Blocking just **25%** of your vents can reduce system efficiency by **40%** and trigger overheating shutoffs.

### Step 5: Inspect the Pilot Light (Gas Furnaces Only)

**Modern furnaces** (post-2010): Usually have electronic ignition—skip to Step 6

**Older gas furnaces**:
1. **Locate pilot light** (small flame visible through window)
2. **Check if flame is blue** and steady
3. **If out, follow relight instructions** on furnace label
4. **Turn gas control to "Pilot"**
5. **Hold reset button while lighting** with long lighter
6. **Hold for 60 seconds**, then release

**Safety warning**: If you smell gas, **don't attempt repairs**. Turn off gas at meter and call your gas company immediately.

### Step 6: Test the Ignition System

**For electronic ignition systems**:
1. **Listen for clicking sounds** when thermostat calls for heat
2. **Look for spark or glow** in burner area
3. **Check for error codes** on furnace display
4. **Reset system** by turning off power for 30 seconds

**Common error codes**:
- **Flashing red light**: Ignition failure
- **Steady red light**: System lockout
- **No lights**: Power or control board issue

### Step 7: Check Gas Supply (Professional Territory)

**Signs of gas supply issues**:
- **Other gas appliances** not working properly
- **Gas meter** not registering usage
- **Yellow or orange flames** instead of blue
- **Strong gas odor** anywhere in home

**Stop here and call professionals** if you suspect gas problems. Gas work requires licensed technicians and can be extremely dangerous.

## When to Call for Professional Help: Clear Warning Signs

**Call immediately** if you notice:

- **Gas odors** anywhere in your home
- **Carbon monoxide detector** alarming
- **Yellow or orange flames** in burner (should be blue)
- **Cracked heat exchanger** (metal fatigue lines)
- **Unusual noises**: grinding, squealing, or banging
- **Repeated system cycling** on and off
- **Ice formation** on outdoor unit (heat pumps)

**Schedule within 24 hours** for:
- **No improvement** after completing all DIY steps
- **Intermittent heating** that comes and goes
- **Uneven heating** between rooms (more than 5°F difference)
- **Higher than normal** energy bills without usage changes
- **System age over 15 years** with recurring problems

> **Pro Tip**: **82%** of major furnace failures show warning signs **2-4 weeks** before complete breakdown. Address issues early to avoid emergency service fees (typically **2-3x higher**).

2. **Thermostat too close** to heat source—relocate if needed
3. **Oversized furnace** for your home—requires professional assessment
4. **Blocked vents** causing overheating—clear all obstructions
5. **Failing limit switch**—needs professional repair

**Normal cycling**: 3-8 times per hour during moderate weather, longer cycles during extreme cold.

### What's that smell when my furnace first starts?

**Normal smells** (first few uses of season):
- **Dusty/musty odor**: Dust burning off heat exchanger (harmless)
- **Metallic smell**: Expanding metal components (normal)

**Concerning smells** (shut off immediately):
- **Gas/rotten egg**: Potential gas leak—call gas company
- **Electrical/burning plastic**: Wiring problem—call electrician
- **Oil/petroleum**: Possible oil leak—call HVAC technician

### How often should I have my furnace serviced?

**Annual service** is optimal, ideally in **early fall** before heating season. Professional tune-ups include:
- **Complete system inspection** (45-60 minutes)
- **Cleaning and adjustments** 
- **Safety testing** (carbon monoxide, gas leaks)
- **Efficiency measurements**
- **Component replacement** if needed

**Cost**: $150-300 depending on region and system complexity.

**ROI**: Annual service typically **saves $200-500** in prevented repairs and **5-15%** on energy costs.

### Should I repair or replace my old furnace?

**Replace if**:
- **Age over 15 years** AND needs major repair (over $1,000)
- **Efficiency below 80%** AFUE
- **Repair costs exceed 50%** of replacement cost
- **Frequent breakdowns** (3+ repairs in past 2 years)

**Repair if**:
- **Age under 10 years** with good maintenance history
- **Simple component failure** (blower motor, thermostat)
- **Total repair under $500**
- **Recent efficiency upgrade** still viable

**Calculate replacement value**: (Annual fuel savings + Avoided repairs) × Years remaining = Break-even point
