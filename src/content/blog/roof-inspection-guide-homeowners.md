Regular roof inspections are one of the smartest things you can do as a homeowner. A $200 professional inspection can catch problems early and save you thousands in major repairs. But you can also perform basic inspections yourself between professional visits. This guide covers everything you need to know about inspecting your roof safely and effectively.

## Why Roof Inspections Matter

Your roof silently protects your home 24/7, but small problems can quickly become expensive emergencies:

| Issue | Caught Early | Caught Late |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Missing shingles** | $150-$500 repair | $2,000-$8,000 leak damage |
| **Flashing leak** | $200-$600 repair | $5,000-$15,000 water damage |
| **Minor sagging** | $500-$2,000 reinforcement | $8,000-$25,000 full replacement |
| **Clogged gutter** | $0 DIY cleaning | $1,500-$5,000 rot/foundation issues |

**Bottom line**: A twice-yearly inspection can prevent 90% of expensive roof problems.

## How Often Should You Inspect Your Roof?

### Recommended Schedule

**Professional inspections**:
- Every 3 years for roofs under 10 years old
- Every 1-2 years for roofs 10-20 years old
- Annually for roofs over 20 years old
- After major storms (hail, high winds, hurricanes)

**DIY inspections**:
- Twice yearly (spring and fall)
- After severe weather events
- Whenever you notice interior water stains
- Before buying/selling a home

> **Pro Tip**: Schedule inspections in spring (after winter damage) and fall (before winter weather).

## DIY Roof Inspection: Safety First

### Safety Equipment You'll Need

✅ Sturdy ladder with stabilizer bar
✅ Non-slip shoes with good grip
✅ Safety harness (for steep roofs)
✅ Binoculars (for ground inspection)
✅ Flashlight or headlamp
✅ Camera or phone for documentation
✅ Garden hose (for leak testing)

### Safety Rules

🚨 **NEVER**:
- Inspect in wet, icy, or windy conditions
- Go on roof alone
- Step on steep roofs (>6:12 pitch) without harness
- Walk on tile, slate, or brittle shingles
- Lean ladder against gutters
- Inspect if you're uncomfortable with heights

✅ **ALWAYS**:
- Have someone spot your ladder
- Use proper ladder angle (4:1 ratio)
- Wear slip-resistant footwear
- Stay off roof if possible (use binoculars)
- Work during daylight hours
- Know your limits—hire a pro if uncertain

## Ground-Level Inspection Checklist

**You can spot 70% of roof problems from the ground with binoculars.**

### Exterior Visual Inspection (from ground)

Walk around your house and check for:

#### Shingles & Roof Surface
- [ ] **Missing shingles** (gaps or exposed underlayment)
- [ ] **Curling/buckling shingles** (edges lifting or warping)
- [ ] **Cracked or damaged shingles** (visible breaks)
- [ ] **Loose or exposed nails** (metal showing through)
- [ ] **Granule loss** (shiny spots, uneven color)
- [ ] **Sagging areas** (dips or valleys in roof line)
- [ ] **Moss or algae growth** (green/black streaks or patches)

#### Flashing & Seals
- [ ] **Chimney flashing** (gaps, rust, or separation)
- [ ] **Valley flashing** (damage where roof planes meet)
- [ ] **Vent pipe boots** (cracked rubber or loose seals)
- [ ] **Skylight seals** (gaps or deterioration)
- [ ] **Roof-to-wall flashing** (where roof meets siding)

#### Gutters & Drainage
- [ ] **Clogged gutters** (overflowing, plant growth)
- [ ] **Sagging gutters** (pulling away from house)
- [ ] **Granules in gutters** (looks like coarse sand)
- [ ] **Downspouts draining properly** (not clogged)
- [ ] **Water stains** on exterior walls below gutters

#### Structure
- [ ] **Sagging roof deck** (visible dips between rafters)
- [ ] **Daylight through roof boards** (visible from ground?)
- [ ] **Loose or damaged soffits/fascia** (rotting wood)

### Interior Inspection (attic & ceilings)

Go into your attic with a flashlight and check:

#### Attic Interior
- [ ] **Daylight coming through roof** (holes or gaps)
- [ ] **Water stains on rafters or decking** (dark streaks)
- [ ] **Sagging decking** (bowing between rafters)
- [ ] **Mold or mildew** (musty smell, black spots)
- [ ] **Proper ventilation** (ridge/soffit vents clear)
- [ ] **Adequate insulation** (no compressed or wet spots)
- [ ] **Pest evidence** (droppings, nests, damage)

#### Interior Ceilings
- [ ] **Water stains** (brown rings, discoloration)
- [ ] **Peeling paint** near ceiling/walls
- [ ] **Sagging ceiling** (bowing drywall)
- [ ] **Mold growth** on ceiling or walls

> **Pro Tip**: Take photos during each inspection. Compare images over time to track deterioration.

## On-Roof Inspection (If Safe to Do So)

**Only attempt if you have proper safety equipment and a roof pitch under 6:12.**

### Close-Up Inspection Points

#### Shingle Condition
- [ ] Press on shingles—do they feel brittle or soft?
- [ ] Lift shingle edges gently—are they sealed properly?
- [ ] Check for granule loss—can you see the asphalt mat?
- [ ] Look for cracking, tears, or punctures
- [ ] Inspect around nails—any lifting or gaps?

#### Penetrations & Flashing
- [ ] **Vent pipes**: Rubber boot cracked or separated?
- [ ] **Chimney**: Flashing sealed, no gaps or rust?
- [ ] **Skylights**: Seals intact, no cracks in glass?
- [ ] **Valleys**: Metal flashing secure, no holes?
- [ ] **Ridge vents**: Properly sealed, not damaged?

#### Roof Deck
- [ ] Walk carefully—does deck feel spongy or soft?
- [ ] Any visible sagging between rafters?
- [ ] Check for "waves" in roof surface

#### Penetrations You Might Miss
- [ ] Plumbing vents
- [ ] Attic vents
- [ ] Exhaust fan vents
- [ ] Satellite dish/antenna mounts
- [ ] Solar panel mounts

## What to Look For: Common Roof Problems

### 1. Granule Loss (Asphalt Shingles)

**What it looks like**: Shiny or bare spots on shingles; black asphalt showing through; heavy granule accumulation in gutters

**What it means**:
- Normal aging (after 15-20 years)
- Storm damage (hail)
- Manufacturing defect

**Action**:
- Light loss: Monitor annually
- Heavy loss: Plan for replacement within 2-5 years
- Severe loss: Replace now

### 2. Curling or Buckling Shingles

**What it looks like**:
- **Curling**: Edges turning up or down
- **Buckling**: Shingles bowing in the middle

**What it means**:
- Poor ventilation (heat buildup)
- Moisture in attic
- Defective shingles
- Improper installation
- End of lifespan

**Action**: Replace affected sections; if widespread, full replacement needed

### 3. Missing Shingles

**What it looks like**: Gaps in roof coverage; exposed tar paper or felt

**What it means**:
- Wind damage
- Poor installation (improper nailing)
- Aging adhesive

**Action**: Replace immediately (water damage risk)

### 4. Flashing Problems

**What it looks like**:
- Gaps between flashing and roof/wall
- Rust or corrosion
- Bent or damaged metal
- Cracked caulk or sealant

**What it means**: Primary leak source

**Action**: Repair/replace flashing; reseal as needed

### 5. Moss & Algae Growth

**What it looks like**:
- **Algae**: Black or dark streaks (common on north-facing slopes)
- **Moss**: Green, fuzzy growth (retains moisture)
- **Lichen**: White/gray crusty growth

**What it means**:
- Moisture retention
- Shingle degradation (moss lifts shingles)
- Mostly cosmetic (algae)

**Action**:
- Algae: Cosmetic; clean if desired
- Moss: Remove carefully (can damage shingles); improve shade/ventilation
- Lichen: Professional cleaning recommended

> **Warning**: Never pressure wash shingles—it destroys the protective granules. Use gentle low-pressure cleaning or hire pros.

### 6. Sagging Roof Deck

**What it looks like**: Visible dip or valley where roof should be flat; wavy appearance

**What it means**:
- **SERIOUS ISSUE**: Structural damage from:
  - Long-term water damage
  - Inadequate support
  - Excessive weight (multiple roof layers)

**Action**: Call professional immediately—potential collapse risk

### 7. Damaged or Deteriorated Rubber Boots

**What it looks like**: Cracked, split, or separated rubber around vent pipes

**What it means**: Common leak source (rubber degrades in 10-15 years)

**Action**: Replace boots (relatively inexpensive repair)

## Seasonal Roof Inspection Guide
