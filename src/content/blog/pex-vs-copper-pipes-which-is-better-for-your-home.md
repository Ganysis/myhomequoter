## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is PEX safe for drinking water?

**Yes, PEX is NSF-certified safe for potable water.** Modern PEX meets NSF/ANSI Standard 61 for drinking water safety. However, new PEX installations may have a plastic taste for 1-2 weeks that flushes out with regular use. Choose PEX-A or PEX-B from reputable manufacturers like Uponor, Rehau, or SharkBite.

### How long do PEX pipes last compared to copper?

**PEX pipes last 40-50 years while copper lasts 70-100 years.** However, PEX failure is typically gradual (fittings first), while copper can fail suddenly with pinhole leaks. The lower upfront cost of PEX often justifies replacement after 40 years, especially considering improved materials available by then.

### Can I mix PEX and copper in the same system?

**Yes, but use proper transition fittings to prevent galvanic corrosion.** Install dielectric unions or brass transition fittings where PEX connects to copper. Many professionals use copper for the main line and PEX for branch lines - this hybrid approach costs 20-30% less than all-copper while maintaining durability.

### Which is better for DIY installation?

**PEX is significantly easier for DIY installation.** PEX requires basic tools ($50-100) and no soldering skills. Copper requires torch work, soldering experience, and costs $200-300 in specialized tools. However, improper PEX fitting installation causes 80% of PEX failures, so follow manufacturer instructions precisely.

### Do PEX pipes affect home resale value?

**Copper pipes typically add more resale value than PEX.** Real estate appraisers often view copper as premium materials, especially in higher-end homes. However, PEX doesn't negatively impact value in most markets. The key is proper installation and documentation - keep permits and inspection records for potential buyers.

### What about environmental impact?

**Copper is more environmentally friendly long-term.** Copper is 100% recyclable and lasts twice as long as PEX. PEX recycling is limited, though some manufacturers now accept returns. However, PEX manufacturing requires 70% less energy than copper mining and processing. Consider your priorities: upfront environmental cost (copper) vs. end-of-life disposal (PEX).

### Which performs better in earthquake zones?

**PEX performs better in seismic areas due to flexibility.** PEX can bend and flex without breaking, while rigid copper may crack at joints during ground movement. California and other seismic zones increasingly prefer PEX for supply lines. However, ensure proper strapping and supports per local building codes.

## Making Your Final Decision
