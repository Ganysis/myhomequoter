## How to Choose Between Gas and Electric Furnaces

The right choice depends on five critical factors that affect both immediate costs and long-term value:

### Step 1: Evaluate Your Home's Current Infrastructure

**Check gas availability**: If your home already has natural gas service, a gas furnace typically makes financial sense. Extending new gas lines to a home costs **$500-$2,000** depending on distance from the main line.

**Assess electrical capacity**: Electric furnaces require **60-100 amp circuits**. Homes built before 1980 often need panel upgrades costing **$1,200-$3,000**.

### Step 2: Calculate Operating Costs for Your Area

Use this formula to compare annual heating costs:

**Gas furnace annual cost** = (Home square footage × 30-60 BTU × Heating degree days × Gas price per therm) ÷ (Furnace efficiency × 100,000)

**Electric furnace annual cost** = (Home square footage × 8.8-17.6 kWh × Electricity price per kWh)

> **Real Example**: A 2,000 sq ft home in Chicago with gas at $1.20/therm and electricity at $0.13/kWh:
> - Gas furnace (90% AFUE): $720/year
> - Electric furnace: $1,440/year
> - **Annual savings with gas: $720**

### Step 3: Consider Climate and Heating Demands

**Cold climates** (zones 4-7): Gas furnaces maintain efficiency and provide faster, more comfortable heating when outdoor temperatures drop below 32°F.

**Moderate climates** (zones 1-3): Electric furnaces work well and may pair effectively with heat pumps for shoulder seasons.

### Step 4: Factor in Lifespan and Maintenance

- **Gas furnaces**: 15-20 year lifespan, annual maintenance $100-$200
- **Electric furnaces**: 20-25 year lifespan, annual maintenance $75-$150

### Step 5: Evaluate Safety and Environmental Concerns

**Gas furnace considerations**:
- Requires carbon monoxide detectors
- Professional annual inspections essential
- Risk of gas leaks (though rare with proper maintenance)

**Electric furnace advantages**:
- No combustion byproducts
- No gas leak risk
- Cleaner indoor air quality

## Signs You Need Furnace Replacement

Recognize these indicators that your current furnace needs replacement rather than repair:

• **Age over 15 years** with increasing repair frequency
• **Rising energy bills** despite similar usage patterns  
• **Uneven heating** throughout your home
• **Strange noises** like banging, rattling, or squealing
• **Yellow pilot light flame** (should be blue) on gas units
• **Frequent cycling** on and off
• **Visible rust or corrosion** on the heat exchanger
• **Increased dust** or poor indoor air quality
• **Repair costs exceeding 50%** of replacement value

> **Pro Tip**: If your furnace needs a major repair (like heat exchanger replacement) and it's over 12 years old, replacement usually provides better long-term value.
