## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best roofing material?

**There is no single "best" material**—it depends on budget, climate, home style, and priorities. Metal offers the best overall value for longevity and performance, but architectural asphalt shingles are best for typical suburban homes on a budget.

### How long does each roofing material last?

- Asphalt: 15-30 years
- Metal: 40-70 years
- Tile: 50-100 years
- Slate: 75-200 years
- Wood: 20-40 years

### Which roofing material is most energy efficient?

**Metal roofing** is most energy efficient, reflecting solar heat and reducing cooling costs 10-25%. Clay tile is second-best due to thermal mass properties.

### Can I install a heavier roof material on my existing structure?

**Not always**. Tile and slate may require structural reinforcement. A structural engineer should evaluate your home before installing materials weighing >800 lbs per square.

### What roofing material is best for resale value?

**Metal roofing** has the highest ROI at 85-95%. Buyers appreciate the longevity and low maintenance. Architectural asphalt shingles offer solid 60-68% ROI.

### Which roofing material requires the least maintenance?

**Metal roofing** requires the least maintenance—typically just occasional inspections and clearing debris. Tile and slate are also very low-maintenance.

### Are there eco-friendly roofing options?

Yes! Best choices:
1. **Metal** (recycled content, fully recyclable)
2. **Tile** (natural materials, very long lifespan)
3. **Slate** (100% natural stone)
4. **Wood** (renewable, biodegradable)
