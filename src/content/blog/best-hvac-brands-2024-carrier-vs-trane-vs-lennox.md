## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which HVAC brand lasts the longest?

**Trane consistently delivers the longest lifespan** at 18-22 years on average, followed by Carrier (15-20 years) and Lennox (16-19 years). Trane's superior build quality and all-aluminum coils contribute to exceptional durability, especially in harsh climates.

### Are premium HVAC brands worth the extra cost?

**Yes, for most homeowners.** Premium brands offer **25-40% better energy efficiency**, **30-50% fewer repairs**, and **2-5 year longer lifespans**. Over 15 years, you'll typically save **$2,000-$5,000** in energy and repair costs compared to budget brands.

### How much should I expect to pay for installation?

**Professional installation costs $1,500-$4,000** depending on system complexity. This includes **labor ($100-$150/hour)**, **permits ($50-$200)**, **materials ($200-$500)**, and **disposal fees ($100-$300)**.
