Regular HVAC maintenance is one of the smartest investments you can make as a homeowner. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently, lasts longer, and keeps your energy bills in check. Here's your complete seasonal maintenance guide.

## Why HVAC Maintenance Matters

The numbers speak for themselves:

- **15-25%**: Energy savings from regular maintenance
- **40%**: Of AC breakdowns are due to lack of maintenance
- **15-20 years**: Expected lifespan with proper care (vs. 10-12 without)
- **$3,000-$7,000**: Average replacement cost you can delay or avoid

## Spring Checklist (Before Cooling Season)

### DIY Tasks
- [ ] Replace or clean air filters
- [ ] Clear debris from outdoor unit (at least 2 feet clearance)
- [ ] Clean supply and return vents
- [ ] Test thermostat operation
- [ ] Check condensate drain line for clogs
- [ ] Inspect visible ductwork for damage

### Professional Service
- [ ] Refrigerant level check
- [ ] Clean evaporator and condenser coils
- [ ] Inspect electrical connections
- [ ] Lubricate moving parts
- [ ] Check blower components
- [ ] Verify system startup and operation

## Summer Maintenance Tips

During peak cooling season:

1. **Change filters monthly** during heavy use
2. **Keep outdoor unit clean** - hose off gently if dirty
3. **Don't block vents** with furniture
4. **Set thermostat wisely** - 78°F when home, higher when away
5. **Use ceiling fans** to improve circulation

### Warning Signs During Summer
- System running constantly
- Warm air from vents
- Unusual noises
- Higher than normal bills
- Ice on refrigerant lines

## Fall Checklist (Before Heating Season)

### DIY Tasks
- [ ] Replace air filter
- [ ] Test heating mode
- [ ] Check carbon monoxide detectors
- [ ] Clear area around furnace
- [ ] Inspect flue/chimney for blockages
- [ ] Program thermostat for heating schedule

### Professional Service
- [ ] Inspect heat exchanger
- [ ] Clean and adjust burners
- [ ] Test safety controls
- [ ] Check gas connections

**Important**: Have your furnace inspected before the first cold snap. Technicians get busy once winter hits.

## Winter Maintenance Tips

1. **Keep vents clear** of snow and ice
2. **Change filters regularly**
3. **Set consistent temperatures** - avoid major fluctuations
4. **Don't close too many vents** - this increases system pressure
5. **Keep emergency numbers handy**

### Emergency Preparedness
