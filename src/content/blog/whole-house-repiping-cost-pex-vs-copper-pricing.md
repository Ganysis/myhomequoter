# Whole House Repiping Cost 2024: PEX vs Copper Complete Pricing Guide

Whole house repiping typically costs **$4,500 to $15,000** for most homes, with PEX averaging **30-40% less** than copper installations. The total price depends on your home's size, pipe material choice, and local labor rates.

## Quick Cost Comparison

| Home Size | PEX Total Cost | Copper Total Cost | Savings with PEX |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1,000 sq ft | $3,500-$6,000 | $5,500-$9,500 | $2,000-$3,500 |
| 1,500 sq ft | $4,500-$8,500 | $7,000-$12,500 | $2,500-$4,000 |
| 2,000 sq ft | $6,000-$11,000 | $9,500-$16,000 | $3,500-$5,000 |
| 2,500 sq ft | $7,500-$13,500 | $12,000-$20,000 | $4,500-$6,500 |

As a licensed contractor with 15 years of plumbing experience, I've overseen hundreds of repiping projects. This guide provides the exact costs you can expect in 2024, helping you make an informed decision between PEX and copper systems.

## What Is Whole House Repiping?

Whole house repiping involves **completely replacing** all water supply lines in your home, from the main water line to every fixture. This major plumbing renovation typically takes **3-7 days** and requires opening walls to access existing pipes.

Repiping becomes necessary when:
- Pipes are **25+ years old** (galvanized steel or old copper)
- You experience **frequent leaks** or low water pressure
- Water quality issues persist despite filtration
- Planning major renovations that require plumbing updates

> **Pro Tip:** Repiping during kitchen or bathroom renovations can save **15-25%** on total costs since walls are already open for other work.

## Detailed Cost Breakdown: PEX vs Copper

### Material Costs Per Linear Foot

| Pipe Type | Material Cost | Fittings Cost | Total Per Linear Foot |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **PEX-A (Uponor)** | $0.75-$1.25 | $2.50-$4.00 | $3.25-$5.25 |
| **PEX-B (SharkBite)** | $0.50-$0.85 | $2.00-$3.50 | $2.50-$4.35 |

**Copper Installation Labor:** $4.00-$7.00 per linear foot

| Region | PEX Labor Rate | Copper Labor Rate | Why the Difference |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Southeast** | $2.50-$3.50 | $4.00-$5.50 | Lower cost of living |
| **Midwest** | $3.00-$4.00 | $4.50-$6.00 | Average market rates |
| **Northeast** | $3.50-$4.50 | $5.50-$7.00 | Higher labor costs |

- **Temporary water service:** $200-$500
- **Disposal fees:** $300-$800

## Step-by-Step Repiping Process

### 1. Initial Assessment and Planning (Day 1)

**What happens:** Licensed plumber inspects existing system, creates installation plan
**Duration:** 2-4 hours
**Your involvement:** Discuss fixture locations, access concerns

### 2. Permit Acquisition (1-3 days before work)

**Required documents:**
- Detailed plumbing plan
- Material specifications
- Contractor license verification

### 3. Preparation and Setup (Day 1)

**Steps include:**
- Turn off main water supply
- Set up temporary water connections
- Protect furniture and belongings
- Mark wall cutting locations

### 4. Demolition and Old Pipe Removal (Days 1-2)

**Process:**
- Strategic wall openings for access
- Careful removal of old piping
- Inspection of wall cavities for damage

> **Pro Tip:** Take photos of pipe routing before removal. This helps electricians and HVAC technicians avoid conflicts during future work.

### 5. New Pipe Installation (Days 2-4)

**PEX installation specifics:**
- **Manifold system:** Central distribution point with individual lines to each fixture
- **Expansion fittings:** No glue or solder required
- **Color coding:** Red for hot water, blue for cold water

**Copper installation specifics:**
- **Soldered joints:** Requires skilled welding techniques
- **Rigid installation:** Less flexibility around obstacles
- **Support requirements:** Every 6-8 feet for horizontal runs

### 6. Pressure Testing and Inspection (Day 4-5)

**Testing protocol:**
- **Pressure test:** 150 PSI for 2+ hours
- **Flow test:** Verify adequate pressure at all fixtures
- **Municipal inspection:** Required before wall closure

### 7. Wall Restoration (Days 5-7)

**Restoration includes:**
- Drywall patching or replacement
- Texture matching
- Primer and paint application

## Signs You Need Whole House Repiping

### Immediate Red Flags

• **Discolored water** - Brown, yellow, or rust-colored water indicates pipe corrosion
• **Multiple leaks per year** - More than 2-3 leaks annually suggests systemic failure
• **Low water pressure** - Consistent pressure below 40 PSI throughout the house
• **Metallic taste** - Indicates copper or iron leaching from deteriorating pipes
• **Visible corrosion** - Green or white buildup on exposed copper pipes

### Age-Based Indicators

• **Galvanized steel pipes (1950s-1980s):** Replace immediately if 40+ years old
• **Original copper (1960s-1990s):** Consider replacement at 50+ years
• **Early PEX (1990s):** Inspect for recalls and UV damage

### Performance Issues

• **Temperature fluctuations** - Inconsistent hot water delivery
• **Strange noises** - Banging, whistling, or gurgling sounds
• **High water bills** - Hidden leaks increase usage costs
• **Frequent plumber visits** - Ongoing repairs indicate system failure

> **Expert Insight:** I recommend repiping when repair costs exceed **30% of replacement costs** over a 2-year period. This "30% rule" helps homeowners avoid throwing good money after bad.
