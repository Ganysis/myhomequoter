## Expert Tips for Maximizing Water Heater Performance and Lifespan

### Installation Best Practices

3. **Check anode rod** every 3-4 years (replace when **75%** consumed)
4. **Insulate hot water pipes** to reduce standby losses
5. **Set thermostat to 120°F** for optimal efficiency and safety

**Professional maintenance**: Schedule annual service costing **$150-$250** to extend lifespan by **2-4 years**.

### Money-Saving Strategies

**Timing your purchase**: Shop during **spring and fall** for best prices and availability. Avoid emergency summer and winter replacement when prices spike **15-25%**.

**Rebate opportunities**: Check utility company rebates averaging **$200-$800** for high-efficiency models. Federal tax credits offer additional **$300-$2,000** for qualifying heat pump units.

**Bundle installation**: Combine water heater replacement with other plumbing work to reduce labor costs by **10-20%**.
